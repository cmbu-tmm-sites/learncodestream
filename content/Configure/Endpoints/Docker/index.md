The Docker Endpoint provides an execution environment for [CI Tasks](/pipelines/tasks/ci) and [Custom Integrations](/custom-integrations) which are executed inside a container image on the configured Docker host. 

* **Project** - endpoints are assigned to a Project to provide scope of access
* **Type** - Docker
* **Name** - a name to identify the Docker Endpoint
* **Description** - description of the Docker Endpoint
* **Mark restricted** - if enabled, only Code Stream or Project Administrators can execute Pipelines using this endpoint
* **Cloud proxy** - (vRA Cloud only) the Cloud Proxy appliance through which the endpoint should communicate
* **URL** - the address including protocol (http/https) and port for the Docker API
* **Shared Path** - a folder on the Docker host where the logs and artefacts generated in executions will be stored
