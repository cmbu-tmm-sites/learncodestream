Code Stream Tasks are the basic units of a Pipeline, with different task types interacting with different systems.

## Common configuration
Some configuration is common accross all task types

### Precondition and Continue on failure
The precondition field can be used to determine if a Task should be executed - if the pre-condition evaluates to `true` the task will execute.

For example, if a task should only execute if a previous task completed successfully you can test the status of that task `${Stage0.task0.output.status} == "COMPLETED"`

If **Continue on failure** is checked, the failure of this Task will not cause the entire Pipeline to fail. It can be combined with the precondition field to conditionally run subsequent tasks by checking the status of the failing task.

### Task Notifications
Task notifications are almost identical to [Pipeline notifications](/Pipelines/#notifications) except that they offer a specific events for the task (completes, is waiting, fails, starting).

### Rollback
The Task Rollback setting allows you to configure a Pipeline that will be executed in the event that the Task fails. This can be used to clean up any artefacts generated by the Task execution that may be in an incomplete state. When you select the Rollback Pipeline you can configure the inputs for the selected pipeline, which would typically be variables from your parent (failing) Pipeline.
