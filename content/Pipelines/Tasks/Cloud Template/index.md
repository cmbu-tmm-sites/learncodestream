title: "VMware Cloud Template"
---
The VMWare Cloud Template task can be used to Create, Update, Delete, and Rollback Deployments in vRealize Automation Cloud Assembly.

**API token** - the only common setting across all actions in this task is the API token. This is an API token with permissions to vRealize Automation Cloud Assembly API to perfom the Action on a Deployment. You can enter the token directly in the field, however you should use a Secret or Restricted variable to avoid the token being visible in pipeline logs. The Generate Token button will open a form to generate an API token from credentials you enter

## Actions
There are four different actions you can perform against the VMware Cloud Templates
